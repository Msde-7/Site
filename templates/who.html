            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Frustrated by the challenges of obtaining support for their organizations and the lack of meaningful advocacy for individual students, the ACTION team came together to change the status quo. They believe every student deserves a government that listens, acts, and prioritizes their needs—whether it's streamlining campus services, creating more opportunities for involvement, or ensuring a transparent and student-focused administration.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
            <p>With a commitment to efficiency, engagement, and advocacy, ACTION is here to take bold steps to build a campus where every voice is heard, every student is supported, and no one feels left behind. Because at ACTION, it's not just about leading—it's about serving.</p>

        <h2>Why the Name ACTION?</h2>
        <p>The name ACTION is more than a title—it's a philosophy. Inspired by the phrase "Lights, Camera, Action," it reflects what a great administration should embody: transparency, accountability, and proactive change.</p>

            <h3>Lights: Transparency at Every Step</h3>
            <p>Just as lights illuminate a stage, ACTION is committed to operating in full view of the student body. Everything we do will be open, transparent, and for the students. We welcome dialogue, even disagreement, to ensure the best solutions are found. Our priority is creating a student government that truly represents and listens to the campus community.</p>

            <h3>Camera: Accountability and Scrutiny</h3>
            <p>A camera captures everything, and so should we. ACTION believes in being held accountable for the promises we make. We encourage the student body to scrutinize our progress and ensure we deliver on our commitments. If we say it, we mean it—and we will follow through.</p>

            <h3>Action: Taking Steps to Make a Difference</h3>
            <p>At its core, ACTION is about doing, not just talking. We don't wait for problems to fix themselves; we tackle them head-on. Listening to the student body and taking direction from your concerns, we will aggressively and proactively work to improve campus life. From streamlining processes to amplifying student voices, ACTION will be a force for meaningful, lasting change.</p>
