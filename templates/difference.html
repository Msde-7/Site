                    <h4>What Sets Us Apart:</h4>
                    <p>The current administration has left many students wondering what student government even does. ACTION will shine a light on every decision, ensuring all processes and initiatives are visible and easy to follow.</p>

                    <p>Other campaigns make promises during election season, only to let them fade away. ACTION is built on a foundation of accountability, encouraging students to hold us to our word.</p>
