                    <p>Hi, I'm Ava Smith from Chatham, NJ! I am a student at Indiana University, majoring in Healthcare Management and Policy with a minor in Human Resources. My passion for leadership and service has shaped my time at IU, and I'm committed to making a difference both on campus and beyond.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>O'Neill School Ambassador</strong><br>
                    As an ambassador for the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs, I guide prospective students by giving tours, leading information sessions, and supporting their transition to IU.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>IUDM Hospital Relations Committee</strong><br>
                    My involvement with IUDM (Indiana University Dance Marathon) allows me to directly support Riley Hospital for Children, a cause close to my heart.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Alpha Gamma Delta</strong><br>
                    I'm also a proud member of Alpha Gamma Delta sorority, where I contribute to fighting hunger both nationally and locally through efforts like volunteering at the Hoosier Hills Food Bank in Bloomington.</p>
                    
                    <p class="bio-vision">I believe in the power of collective action to improve lives, and I'm excited to bring that same energy and drive to the ACTION campaign. Together, we can make IU a campus where every voice is heard, every student is supported, and every opportunity is within reach.</p>
